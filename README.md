This script is for Use with IDX Broker and ListHub

It is based on these docs: https://app.listhub.com/tracking-docs/v3/listing-metrics-js.html

You will need to:
Replace METRICS_PROVIDER_ID with the metrics provider id identified in the email you received from support. An example provider id would be 'M-999999'. Note: This is a string value and should be quoted.

Replace TEST with either true or false to determine whether events being reported will be made available on the ListHub reports from this page. This can be used to distinguish events submitted from QA and Production environments.

PLace the script in a IDX Broker Details page wrapper or subheader.
